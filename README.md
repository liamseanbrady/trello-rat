### A Simple Trello Client for the Command Line

- Run `bundle`

- Add a `.config` file in the root directory. This is a YAML file and must contain `key` and `app_name` keys.
    ```
    key: 'yourtrellodeveloperkeyhere'
    app_name: 'Trello Rat'
    ```

### The Purpose of this Project

- Here are some of the reasons why I decided to start this project

  1. Learning to build a useful CLI client for something I use regularly.
  2. A chance to practice TDD outside of a Rails project.
  3. For me, learning how to consume an API from scratch and tailor it to my own specifications seems like a good way to understand how to build a API myself.
  4. Going into the wilderness far away from any tutorials makes you realize exactly what you don't know. It can be a mildly discouraging experience at first. but it usually pays off in the end.
